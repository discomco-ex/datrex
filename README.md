# DaTrex: A Decentralized Artificial Organism Experiment.

## DESCRIPTION

_Datrex_  is the name of an experiment in gaining 
insights from and experience with developing a Decentralized Artificial Organism in Erlang/Elixir. 
This experiment will be heavily influenced by the work of 
(Dr. Gene I. Sher)[https://www.linkedin.com/in/gene-sher-phd-86a11711/]
(Handbook of Neuroevolution through Erlang)[https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MgNmy8PIeyQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=%22Gene+I.+Sher%22&ots=j0cYOHRwsi&sig=Zm1vn3bP2iZ-Zkl8y4YzeBzEiSA#v=onepage&q=%22Gene%20I.%20Sher%22&f=false].

## CHALLENGE and OUTCOME

An interesting aspect to observe during this experiment, is the evolution in reasoning I will undergo, from complete novice in Neuroevolution as well as Erlang towards someone who can say a few words that make sense, on both topics.

## TOOLS

- VSCode with Erlang and Elixir Extensions
- Rider with Erlang and Elixir Extensions
- Erlang/OTP v25
- mix/iex/erl/cerl

## JOURNAL

20.05.23 - Day Zero

- very basic knowledge about how Neural Networks are supposed to work.
- basic knowledge of Erlang/OTP and Elixir

> IDEA
> Build in Erlang a basic building block that can serve as a kind of 'cell', 
> with `sensors`, `actuators`, `inputs` and `outputs`. Each `cell` will have two main drivers:
>1. Energy -19 ~> 99
>2. Happiness 0 ~> 99
> 

21.05.23 - Day One

-I've decided to go for Elixir. The ecosystem is a little more user-friendly than pure Erlang's. 
In the end, it all compiles to the BEAM and apps should be compatible. Also, it allows me to Rider's plugins.
